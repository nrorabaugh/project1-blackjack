            <h2>Welcome to Blackjack</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the game. In case you are new, the rules are as follows: on each hand, your objective is to score as close to 21 points as possible without going over, or "busting". A score of 21 is an automatic win, called blackjack. You will be competing against the dealer; if neither of you score blackjack or bust, whoever scores higher wins. Numbered cards are scored by their number, all face cards have a value of ten, and Aces are worth either one or eleven points. As you have bought in for five hundred dollars, you may bet freely on each hand (with a minimum of 10 dollars). If the game seems to be malfunctioning, look to the bottom right for helpful hints. Good luck, shark!</p>

                <h2>Sorry, you're out of chips</h2>
                <p>Well, it looks like you bet it all and lost. A sad sight for any self-respecting card player. If you'd like to keep playing, you'll have to buy in again for another five hundred. If not, I'm afraid you'll have to leave the table.</p>
